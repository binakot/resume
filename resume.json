    "summary": "Studying programming since 2007. The winner of the artificial intelligence section at International Scientific Student Conference in Novosibirsk in 2014. A member of the ACM ICPC team for 2 years. Experience in commercial software development since 2012. The first work with a flexible schedule was the position of system administrator in the city clinic. My main responsibilities were HP-UX server administration and development and support of internal workflow automation tools written on the C# and .NET Framework. After I was engaged in the development and support of software for slot machines. Here I got a lot of experience working with hardware, writing drivers, as well as working with graphics. The main stack was C/C++, Linux, OpenGL. Then I became a member of the team of independent game developers Black Cloud Studios. Development was carried out on the Unity engine and C# and JS languages. It was my first experience of the remote job and communication in an English-speaking team. Then I moved from Siberia to the western part of the country. I have been working for more than 4 years at the First Monitoring Company in Krasnodar city. The first couple of years in the position of software developer I participated, and then led the following projects: two desktop SWING and WPF applications, two mobile Android applications, monolithic Java backend server. After that I received a promotion to the technical team leader and I have been conducting a new project Waliot for 2 years. Waliot is IoT platform for GPS navigation and real-time monitoring for fleet and staff resources of our clients. It’s designed with microservice architecture based on Netflix OSS, using CI/CD pipelines, running in Docker Swarm cluster with ELK logging and Prometheus/Grafana monitoring. The backend part is mostly written on Java, but there are services on Kotlin, Python and NodeJS. The frontend applications is written on Angular and TypeScript. Also I participate in several open source projects, organize conferences and meetups, make presentations at major conferences and so on. I always try to learn new technologies and approaches. Most of all I like to work with people on complex and interesting tasks. And the biggest reward for me is a growing business and satisfied customers. I am married and have a little son.",
